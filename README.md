# Mini Microservice App

## Overview

This repository contains a mini microservice architecture designed to demonstrate a simple client-service setup along with backend services. The project includes a frontend service (client) and multiple backend services, all containerized using Docker and orchestrated via Kubernetes.

The goal of this repository is to provide a basic framework for microservice-based architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend Service (Client)**: The client-facing application built to interact with backend services.
- **Backend Services**: Multiple services that handle specific functionality and interact with each other through APIs.
- **Docker**: All services are containerized to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Kubernetes**: The services are orchestrated using Kubernetes for easy deployment and scalability.

## Features

- Client service interacts with multiple backend services via HTTP APIs.
- Services are containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
- Kubernetes is used for orchestrating and scaling services.
- Simple structure with easy-to-understand components for learning and experimentation.
